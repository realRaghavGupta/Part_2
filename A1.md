   This is a banking application provided by DBS Bank India. Digibank is a digital only bank by DBS. The application is used to access all the banking needs. This application is one of the applications I personally use regularly. It allows to consolidate all the banking needs at one place. I recently moved to India, and this is by far the best way to access the accounts back in India, and therefore I have chosen this app.

   A user can download this app to get the banking services by the bank. There is no need to go to any place physically, everything is done in the app. From getting an account, to doing operations, all the things can be done at the touch of a finger.

   The app uses a secure number system, which does not require an otp to be sent each time, but it is generated using combination of hardware and software.

   This application is a utility app, to get access to the banking services provided.

   The strength of the application is to provide all the banking needs at single location. Not only regular banking, but also additional services like UPI / Mutual Funds etc. Everything is put at right location, and the app is very easy to use. The application is sometimes slow, which can be due to slow network connection or some other reason. It crashes once in few weeks, which might be due to a bug or some other problem. ..

   As an improvement, the application can be optimized to run faster, and more information displayed on the screen.

+ #### First Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design
   The application has a consistent design all over. All the information mentioned is precise and even. By looking at the view, one can easily judge, what the given option is there for. The information provided is relevant to the context of the services provided, and present in the right place. The help bar above, clearly asks a question, which helps user identify where to get the help from. The application completely adheres to this heuristic.

+ #### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition rather than recall
   There are no such hidden windows that a user might need to access. On the front page itself the application has various shortcuts, which are clearly visible, to perform any operation. The most used operations are listed in the middle where most of us tend to take our fingers too. So, the common actions are quick, easily recognizable and easy. For all nonspecific tasks, the information is in the menu. Just by looking at the application one can easily recognize which button performs which action. There is no need to remember any option from the app. SO the app is completely in line with this heuristic as it provides a clear recognition of objects in it, rather than making people remember an option. The help bar is available even before login which makes it easy to contact the support in case of any questions before signing up for the app.


## Second Application: Stocard - Rewards Cards Wallet
_Link to application:_ [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.stocard.stocard&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.stocard.stocard&hl=en)

   Stocard is an app to store all your rewards cards on your phone. There are a lot of reward cards everyone has signed up for. Sometimes it becomes a tedious task to keep all the cards with us. This app lets store all the cards in one app. It shows the bar code which can be used during checkout at the locations.

   This application is quite useful and is one of my daily used apps. It is quite easy to use and has a clean interface. Therefore, this app was chosen for review.

   Everyone keeps a lot of reward cards, and this is a simple one drop solution for everyone. The app is free and without ads, and therefore quite useful. It is already used by around 5 million people as mentioned in the app details.

   Based on the reward cards added in the app, the app uses the location, and then tells the nearest stores where the reward card can be used. It also fetches the latest flyers of the stores and show it. The app uses camera to scan the bar code and add it to the app. This makes it simple to add the card, just by pointing the camera at the bar code.

   This is a utility app which makes it simple to use the reward cards.

   The main strength of the application is that it is simple and very easy to use. It has a lot of reward cards database already in it, and there is hardly any reward card option that is not available. Also the list of stores nearby based on the reward cards is a great option.

Improvement in the app can be in the form of processing the bar code. Sometimes it takes time and it is not able to scan the app. That can be improved.

+ #### First Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design
   The application is very simple with material design all over. There is no unnecessary information anywhere in the app. That view is also neatly designed. All things are clearly visible. It is easy to understand the app and all the buttons can be easily known for the functionality. The store locations are sorted based on the distance from the current location, which is pretty neat.

+ #### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Consistency and standards
   The app uses standard android practices. And the application behavior is consistent compared to the default behavior in android. This makes it much easier to use. The buttons are of the default size, and consistent behavior. The application completely adheres to this heuristic. The search is also similar to the default action, similar with the one we can find in play store. The icons used are also similar to the default ones. Therefore the overall app is consistent and use the default android standards.
